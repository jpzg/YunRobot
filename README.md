YunRobot
========

Arduino and python programs for arduino yun controlling a robot via wifi and TCP sockets.
Currently, the arduino is nothing but the slave of the linino processor, which does nothing but pass commands from the TCP connection to the arduino. Later, it may have some autonomy through more complex programs on the linino.
