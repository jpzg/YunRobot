{"name":"Yunrobot","tagline":"A simple mobile robotic platform","body":"### Intro\r\nThe YunRobot is a simple mobile robotic platform for mounting stuff on powered by the Arduino YUN. It has four 3.5\" wheels and two levels, one for mechanics, batteries, and the Yun. The top is for attachments.\r\nSince the Yun has wifi and can create a network, that's how it is controlled. It also has both a typical Arduino 32u4 processor and a Linux AR 9331 processor running Linino, which allows programming in Python.\r\n\r\n### The Code\r\nIf you haven't looked at the repository yet, the robot is programmed with a large chunk of Arduino code, which is the StandardFirmata example modified to connect to the AR9331 processor and make it start its own network. A python program on the AR9331 then connects to the 32u4 and controls it with pyFirmata, while uhttpd serves a webpage that connects back to the python program using WebSockets. The python websocket server is Tornado. Messages from the client are executed as raw code, and so the client page is the actual controller.\r\n\r\n### The Design\r\nCurrently, the design is a 12\" by 13\" rectangle with four 3.5\" wheels mounted in the baseplate instead of sticking out on the sides. One motor on each side drives the wheels using timing belts. The battery is mounted in the middle, with the Yun behind it and an upper level for attachments.","google":"UA-49878613-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
